<h1>Interface</h1>
<p>You can access any of the Inventory system's functions from the menu bar above. The pages are fairly self-explanatory. You may navigate to the main page at any time by clicking on the Blue {{response.title}} link. You may view a total list of devices by clicking the blue number of devices on the main page.</p>
<h1>Using Forms</h1>
<p>The Inventory system makes use of several forms that vary in their usage. The Quick Search fields on the main page search for records matching part or all or the search query. For instance, a search for <b>mi</b> would match <b>mi</b>, <b>mine</b>, and <b>mice</b>. This search is also <i>case-insensitive</i>.</p>
<p>If more than one record is matched by the query, a list of all matching records shown. If only one matching record is found, an edit form for that record is shown.</p>
